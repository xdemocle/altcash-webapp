# Migration Plan: Move Backend to Next.js API Routes

## Overview

This plan outlines the steps to integrate the existing Node.js/Express backend into the Next.js frontend using the App Router API routes. This will create a monolith application, simplifying deployment and reducing CORS issues.

## Benefits

- Simplified deployment as a single application.
- No need for separate backend server.
- Better integration with Next.js features like SSR and caching.
- Easier management of GraphQL endpoints.

## Risks and Challenges

- Handling database connections (MongoDB) in a serverless environment like Cloudflare Workers.
- Ensuring GraphQL schema and resolvers are compatible with Next.js API routes.
- Potential performance impacts from moving to a serverless model.
- Need to update frontend GraphQL client to point to local /api/graphql instead of external URL.

## Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Backup and Branch**: Completed - changes committed (dcb2376).
2. ‚úÖ **Copy Backend Code**: Completed - backend files moved to `app/api` directory.
3. ‚úÖ **Update GraphQL Schema**: Completed - API route created in `app/api/graphql/route.ts`.
4. ‚úÖ **Dependencies**: Installed required packages (bson, wrangler, etc.).
5. ‚è≥ **Database Connection**: In progress - MongoDB connection setup for serverless environment.
6. ‚è≥ **Implement API Routes**: In progress - GraphQL endpoint implementation.
7. ‚è≥ **Test Locally**: Pending - Run `bun run dev` and test `/api/graphql` endpoint.
8. ‚úÖ **Update Frontend**: Completed - Change GraphQL endpoint in frontend code.
9. ‚è≥ **Deploy and Test**: Pending - Deploy to Cloudflare and verify functionality.

## Detailed Steps

### 1. Backup and Branch

- ‚úÖ Completed - All changes committed (dcb2376860f097a54a409172f9c0d88b94bd466f).

### 2. Copy Backend Code

- ‚úÖ Completed - Backend files moved to `app/api` directory.
- ‚úÖ Import paths adjusted for monorepo structure.

### 3. Update GraphQL Schema

- ‚úÖ Created API route in `app/api/graphql/route.ts`.
- ‚úÖ Fixed TypeScript errors in `app/api/datasources/binance.ts`.

### 4. Database Connection

- ‚è≥ Configure MongoDB driver for Cloudflare Workers compatibility.
- ‚è≥ Set up environment variables for database connection.
- ‚è≥ Test connection pooling in serverless environment.

### 5. Implement API Routes

- ‚è≥ Complete GraphQL endpoint implementation in `app/api/graphql/route.ts`.
- ‚è≥ Ensure error handling and logging are in place.
- ‚è≥ Test all resolvers and datasources.

### 6. Test Locally

- Run `bun run dev` and test `/api/graphql` endpoint.

### 7. Update Frontend

- ‚è≥ Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPHQL_SERVER` to `/api/graphql` in .env.local.
- ‚è≥ Update any hard-coded GraphQL URLs in frontend code.

### 8. Deploy and Test

- ‚è≥ Build using `bun run build`.
- ‚è≥ Deploy using OpenNext Cloudflare tools.
- ‚è≥ Test on staging environment.

## Timeline

- Planning: ‚úÖ 1 hour (completed)
- Backend Migration: ‚úÖ 2 hours (completed)
- Database & API Implementation: ‚è≥ 2-3 hours (in progress)
- Testing: ‚è≥ 2-3 hours (pending)
- Deployment: ‚è≥ 1 hour (pending)

## Performance Optimization: GraphQL Ticker Requests

### Problem

Tab switching in `/buy/` pages triggers excessive GraphQL ticker requests due to:

- Full page navigation causing component remounting
- Individual ticker requests for each coin (20-50+ requests per tab)
- Request cancellation when switching tabs quickly

### üöÄ Recommended Implementation Order

1. **Immediate**: Apply increased cache duration fix
   - Extend CoinTicker cache-first policy
   - Increase random delay staggering (100ms ‚Üí 200ms)

2. **Short-term**: Implement client-side tab switching
   - Replace URL navigation with client-side state management
   - Eliminate component remounting and request cancellation
   - Cache data per tab to avoid refetching

3. **Medium-term**: Add batch ticker requests
   - Create `GET_MULTIPLE_TICKERS` GraphQL query
   - Fetch all tickers in single request per tab
   - Reduce network overhead significantly

4. **Long-term**: Enhance overall GraphQL caching strategy
   - Improve URQL cache configuration
   - Add TTL-based cache expiration
   - Implement cache-and-network strategy

### Impact

- Reduce GraphQL requests from 50+ per tab switch to near zero
- Eliminate request cancellation and improve UX
- Better cache utilization across tab switches
